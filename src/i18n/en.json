Your business can only appear once on Google, so it’s difficult to test multiple third parties at once.</li><li><strong>Educate yourself.</strong> It doesn’t take much time to get up to speed with how Business Profile works and understand how to use its features. Review the <a style='text-decoration-thickness: 1px' class='text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline' href='https://www.google.com/business/resources/'>resources and FAQs</a> for a basic introduction to Business Profile, then explore the <a style='text-decoration-thickness: 1px' class='text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline' href='https://support.google.com/business/#topic=4596754' target='_blank'>Help Center</a> to find answers to specific questions. Understanding how Business Profile works will help you make more informed decisions when working with a third party.</li><li><strong>Trust experience.</strong> Companies that have managed hundreds of businesses on Google are more likely to have expertise with Business Profile. Before you hire a third party, talk to its staff members to understand their previous experience managing businesses on Google.</li><li><strong>Evaluate your performance.</strong> You can find a wide range of insights in your Business Profile account that can give you info about how customers are finding and interacting with your business on Google. Spend time each month reviewing your profile's performance and evaluating the results you’re getting from working with a third party. Check for things like updated photos and current business hours, as well as changes in how customers are discovering your business online.</li></ol>",
